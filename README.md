### How to use it
After downloading the Programm its ready to use. Simply place it in any folder or directly on the desktop. I recommand creating a desktop shorcut.
After launching, it generates a task.json file in the Appdata folder. To add a task, enter something in the input field (top left) and select a date. Then click Add.
To move a task you can use the arrows or the sort button. The Sort button sorts by date. To move a task with the arrows you need to select (click on a task) then you can move it with the arrows. **!IMPORTANT!** You can also use the arrows of another task to move the selected one. To **EDIT** the task **select** the task you want to edit then press the pen icon. After that it deletes the Task and puts the infos in the imput fields. You can press ADD to add the edited task. To **DELETE** a task **select** the one you want to delete and press the delete icon.

When you have finished a Task you can check it. A Checked Task becomes red while a unfinished task is green. <br>

## Date

- White -> Today
- Violet -> Tomorrow
- Gray -> Future days
- Blue -> A week
- Red -> Past days

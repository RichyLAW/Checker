### How to use it
After downloading the Programm its ready to use. Simply place it in any folder or directly on the desktop. I recommand creating a desktop shorcut. <br>
After launching, it generates a task.json file in the Appdata folder. To add a task, enter something in the input field (top left) and select a date. Then click Add.<br>
To move a task you can use the arrows or the sort button. The Sort button sorts by date. To move a task with the arrows you need to select (click on a task) then you can move it with the arrows. **Important** You can also use the arrows of another task to move the selected one.
